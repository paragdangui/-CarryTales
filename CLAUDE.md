# Game Idea:

place → Each house has a small door – only one digit number can enter through the left door – so after adding 9 and 8 (9+8)=17 – 17 tries to enter the door, but the door is too small – here 1 and 7 fights – somehow 7 enters the door of the ones house – number 1 is sad – he tries to enter Tens house – he can show like number 1 is flying to the roof of the Tens house and enters through the roof opening – 4 and 5 from tens house welcomes him and adds him too with them to enter the house

There should be background voice over to narrate the steps and rules of the addition.
